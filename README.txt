MULTITASK- How good are you?
This game is based off of the popular flash game Multitask and your objective it to keep Kanye balancing on the bar for as long as you can. While you do this, you have to make sure the raindrops don't reach the bottom of the screen. When three raindrops have reached the bottom, or Kanye has fallen off of his pedestal, the game is over!


-To play you need to install the Processing library Fisica. This can be done in the native processing window by doing the following:

1. Navigate to Sketch--> Import Library---> Add Library
2. Search for Fisica and install it



Controls:
-Mouse to move the rain catcher
-A and D to move the balance pedestal
-R to restart the game to the main menu




Bugs:
-The game continues to keep score after you lose if you blindly move the mouse and hit a raindrop- could be a bigger problem at higher levels

-The physics between the ball and bar are sometimes finicky; The ball sometimes sticks to the bar or the image of Kanye is sometime knocked out of place

-Credits screen is still unfinished, just added for realism
